# sbt-testng-interface - Testing via TestNG in sbt

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sbt/sbt-testng.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sbt/sbt-testng)

This is an implementation of the [sbt test interface](https://github.com/sbt/test-interface) for testing with **[TestNG](http://testng.org)**.

If you're developing in Scala, you can use [Specs2](http://specs2.org) and be happy. However, if you're sentenced to Java, TestNG is a very good alternative to JUnit.

## Usage

Thanks to @asflierl, there is now a convenience sbt plugin which greatly simplifies configuring the testng test interface.

Version 3.1.1 works with sbt 0.13.5 or higher.

Add the following to your project's `plugins.sbt` file:

```scala
addSbtPlugin("de.johoop" % "sbt-testng-plugin" % "3.1.1")
```

Add the following to your project's `build.sbt` file:

```scala
enablePlugins(TestNGPlugin)
```

You can configure TestNG via the settings keys below.

When done, run your tests in sbt as usual via **`sbt test`**.

## Settings

### `testNGVersion`

* *Description:* Version of TestNG to use for the tests.
* *Accepts:* `String`
* *Default:* `"6.11"`

### `testNGOutputDirectory`

* *Description:* Where TestNG stores its test result files.
* *Accepts:* `String`
* *Default:* `"target/testng"`

### `testNGParameters`

* *Description:* Additional TestNG parameters.
* *Accepts:* `Seq[String]`
* *Default:* `Seq()`

### `testNGSuites`

* *Description:* TestNG test suite file paths (yaml or xml).
* *Accepts:* `Seq[String]`
* *Default:* `Seq("src/test/resources/testng.yaml")`

## Note

TestNG uses its own test runner wich works in a very different way compared to the one from sbt. This means that the interface implementation is kind of a hack.

This also means that executing single tests via**`sbt test-only`** won't work. Please use the options of TestNG instead.
